Three Separate Pages linked together in a responsive navbar: Bio, Portfoilio, & Contact Me

### Bio
* Brief description of the website creator (me), and my intentions for the website 
* Includes an image made responsive with the img-fluid class
* Like the other two pages, also includes a sticky footer (although this is emphasized more on portfolio.html)

### Portfolio
* Includes a responsive Carousel container housing images that serve as links to previous work
    * I favoured this approach over rows/columns as it is easily scaled for future additions, and helped familiarize with other Bootstrap components

### Contact Me
* Simple Contact Form, customized to match the overall theme of the website
